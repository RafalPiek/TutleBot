## General Information
- The application was used for learning Python
- The goal was to create a voice interface and use text-to-speech (TTS) technology to create simple asistant. 



## Technologies Used
- Python 3.11.2
- Wikipedia-API 0.5.8
- SpeechRecognition 3.9.0
- pywttr 2.1.0
- pywttr-models 1.1.0
- pyttsx3 2.90

## Features
List the ready features here:
- When the program is turned on, it has a voice activation.
- voice deactivation
- Checking the weather for today, tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow.
- AQuerying Wikipedia.
- Opening YouTube and Google.
- Searching on YouTube and Google.
- Answering what something is and who created it.



## Setup
It is likely that the application will run on any system that has Windows and at least 10 MB of memory. 
Installation: download the TutleBot folder.
Open the folder and run the TubleBot.exe file.



## Usage
The first step is to say activation words, which means "turtle bot" or just "bot". It will say "Listening", and now you can ask the assistant something. When it finishes answering you, it will turn off and wait for you to say the activation words again





## Project Status
Project is: _in progress_ .
When my AI skills improve, I want to add more complex and dynamic command recognition than what I currently have.
